    EntitySpecification:
      description: "EntitySpecification is a class that offers characteristics to\
        \ describe a type of entity. Entities are generic constructs that may be used\
        \ to describe bespoke business entities that are not effectively covered by\
        \ the existing SID model.\nFunctionally, the entity specification acts as\
        \ a template by which entities may be instantiated and described. By sharing\
        \ the same specification, these entities would therefore share the same set\
        \ of characteristics.\nNote: The ‘configurable’ attribute on the specCharacteristics\
        \ determines if an entity instantiated from the entity specification can override\
        \ the value of the attribute. When set to false, the entity instance may not\
        \ define a value that differs from the value in the specification."
