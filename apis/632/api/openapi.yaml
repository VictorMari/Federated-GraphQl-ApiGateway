    \ is created to record individual or organization information before the assignment\
    \ of any role. For example, within the context of a split billing mechanism, Party\
    \ API allows creation of the individual or organization that will play the role\
    \ of 3 rd payer for a given offer and, then, allows consultation or update of\
    \ his information.\n\n### Resources\n- Organization\n- Individual\n- Hub\n\nParty\

    - Retrieve a collection of organizations or individuals according to given criteria\n\
    - Create a new organization or a new individual\n- Update an existing organization\
    \ or an existing individual\n- Delete an existing organization or an existing\
